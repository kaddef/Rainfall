# Rainfall Simulation

This project simulates falling raindrops on a web page using JavaScript and the p5.js library. Users can customize various parameters such as the number of raindrops, their dimensions, gravity, colors, and more through an interactive interface.

## Features

- **Dynamic Raindrop Count**: Adjust the number of raindrops falling on the screen.
- **Customizable Dimensions**: Set the width and height of the raindrops.
- **Gravity/Speed Control**: Modify the speed of the falling raindrops by changing the gravity.
- **Color Customization**: Change the color of the raindrops and background.
- **Audio Playback**: Optionally include background audio with customizable volume.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser or run a local server to view the project.

## Usage

1. **Raindrop Count**: Enter the desired number of raindrops. The maximum limit is 500.
2. **Raindrop Width & Height**: Specify the dimensions of each raindrop.
3. **Gravity/Speed**: Adjust the gravity to change the falling speed of the raindrops.
4. **Raindrop Color**: Choose the color of the raindrops using the color picker.
5. **Background Color**: Select the background color for the canvas.
6. **Audio**: Use the audio player to add background sound to the simulation.
